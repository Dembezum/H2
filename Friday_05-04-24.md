# Plan for Friday.

Today will be a short day, therefore it is limited how much we will be able to
accomplish. I do however have a plan for what we need to do. 



- [ ] **We should drink coffee.**
- [ ] **Kristian will brief Semso on the proxmox enviornment.**
- [ ] We should do our best to keep up on documentation.
- [ ] We should go over our project, assess what we have and don't.
- [ ] We should establish a plan over our DNS Server (We could use BIND).
